This project used the PyGame library for Python. Myself and two other classmates collaborated
over the last month of our Algorithms course to create this visualization as our final project.
I mainly worked on the user interface because I was able to quickly learn how to use PyGame to
create the cells and the UI control elements, as well as the main event loop for the program.
