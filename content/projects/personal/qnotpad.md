This project was inspired by the classic Notepad application on Windows. I used this
opportunity to learn how to use the Qt framework, but this was also my first native (non-web)
project that included a graphical user interface. Previously I had only written code that
printed output to the terminal, which is why I chose to copy the design of a pre-existing
application rather than create my own design.
